 * @class block_utility
 * @ingroup math
 *
 * @brief Calculates the utility associated with a known block, as part of a
 * robot's decision on whether or not to go and attempt to pick it up.
 *
 * Depends on:
 *
 * - Distance of block to nest (Further is better).
 * - Distance of block to robot's current position (closer is better).
 * - Pheromone density associated with the block information (higher is better).

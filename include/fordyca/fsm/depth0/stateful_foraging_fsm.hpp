 * @brief The FSM for an unpartitioned foraging task. Each robot executing this
 * FSM will locate for a block (either a known block or via random exploration),
 * pickup the block and bring it all the way back to the nest.
 *
 * This FSM will only pickup free blocks. Once it has brought a block all the
 * way to the nest and dropped it in the nest, it will signal that its task is
 * complete.
